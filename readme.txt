Automatically share WordPress (image) posts on Pixelfed.

== Description ==
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/).

You choose which Post Types are sharedâ€”though sharing can still be disabled on a per-post basis. Posts without a Featured Image will not be shared. (The plugin currently doesn't look for other images inside the post, that is.)

Supports a number of filter hooks for developers, and is fully compatible with WordPress's new block editor.

More details can be found on [this plugin's GitHub page](https://github.com/janboddez/share-on-pixelfed).

== Installation ==
Alternatively, upload this plugin's ZIP file via the "Upload Plugin" button.

After activation, head over to *Settings > Share on Pixelfed* to authorize WordPress to post to your Pixelfed account.

More detailed instructions can be found on [this plugin's GitHub page](https://github.com/janboddez/share-on-pixelfed).
